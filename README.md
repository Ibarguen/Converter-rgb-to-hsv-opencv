For exameple I need to find the green color is HSV scale but I don't know th values. I can find the green color on this way
in the interface there are six trackbar  H min , H max, S min, S max, V min and V max I can move the values 
my recomendation is S max = 255 V max = 255 and move the others trackbar for find the color you want.

In this picture I found the green color moving the values Hmin = 50, Smin = 55, Vmin = 58, Hmax = 97, Smax = 255, Vmax = 255.
